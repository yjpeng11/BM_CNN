# A comparison between two-stream convolutional neural networks and human biological motion perception

Here are the Python scripts, saved model weights and stimuli used in the current project.

### OpenCV

The OpenCV script processes static image frames to generate optical flows.

### CNN

The CNN scripts implement the spatial CNN of appearance, the temporal CNN of motion, and the two-stream CNN.

### checkpoints

The checkpoint folders contain the model weights after training with natural human action videos from the Human 3.6M dataset and skeletal display based on the same motion tracking dataset.

### stimuli
