# A comparison between two-stream convolutional neural networks and human biological motion perception

Here are the Python scripts used in the current project.

### OpenCV

The OpenCV script processes static image frames to generate optical flows.

### CNN

The CNN scripts implement the spatial CNN of appearance, the temporal CNN of motion, and the two-stream CNN.
